This program has been written in order to add achievements
to https://store.steampowered.com/app/661470/The_Gateway_Trilogy/[The Gateway Trilogy]
in a non-intrusive fashion (mainly because the game engine
does not make it easy to add achievements otherwise). The
game writes achievements to a file that is monitored for
modification. When modified achievements are stored
immediately.

If you use this program for your game please credit me
(Lo√Øc Hoguin). If you wish to distribute or modify the
source code, please check the LICENSE file.

Enjoy!
